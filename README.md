# Pacmen

## Decription
In this project that I made in MITxPro, I made a PacMen factory where you can create your pacmens and start a game to see all of them moving trought the window and bounce into the walls changing the direction.
This was posible by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to create new elements and showing them into the screen.
