# Pacmen

##Â Decription
In this project that I made in MITxPro, I made a PacMen factory where you can create your pacmens and start a game to see all of them moving trought the window and bounce into the walls changing the direction.
This was posible by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript to create new elements and showing them into the screen.

## How to run:

Clone this repo in your local environment usin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EffrenAnthony/pacmen
```

Go to the root of your project and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Intrucctions:

- Create pacmens with the create button
- Create as many as you want
- Start the game with "Start game" button
- Continue clicking to make the game faster

## Roadmap of future improvements:

Some of the next functionalities that I would like to implement in this project are:

- Stop the game
- Restart from scratch
- Restart from last Stop
- Change assets to create randomly between pacman and ghosts
